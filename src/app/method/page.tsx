      <p>
        Secure data pipelines ingest deal flow. Basic summarization and data extraction 
        are handled instantly by commodity models.

        Our focus is the reasoning architecture. The system learns an investor's thesis 
        through continuous feedback loops. This captured judgment is then used to construct 
        highly contextual prompts, allowing the agent to analyze new deals through the 
        specific lens of that investor.
